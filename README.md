# Machine-Learning-Ceramics
This is my Multilayer Perceptron model that learns the patterns of chemical compositions of celdon ceramics. It uses Adam as the optimizer and Categorical Crossentropy as the loss function. I also implemented PCAs to correlate chemical features with the classes of ceramics to eliminate data redunancy. Using a linear regression model, I measured the variable importance using permutation to find the MDA (Mean Decreased Accuracy) of each chemical composition.
